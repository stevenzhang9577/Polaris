# Polaris Documentation

Polaris runs the entire research lifecycle as a single web application: literature survey, idea
generation, idea review, experiment building on real GPU servers, LaTeX paper writing, and paper
review. It is built for individual researchers; registration is gated by a deployment-level
invite code.
The heavy lifting (crawling, parsing, deduplication, metric parsing, citation matching) is
deterministic code; LLMs are reserved for the judgement calls (scoring, synthesis, drafting, review).
Every long task runs as a **Voyage**: a persisted, resumable, human-gated agent run that can span
hours or days without losing state.

For a high-level tour of the product and its feature set, start with the
[project README](../README.md). The documents below go deeper.

## Table of contents

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Introduction](index.md) | What Polaris is, what makes it different, and a stage-by-stage overview of the pipeline with links to each guide. The docs-site homepage. |
| [Getting Started](getting-started.md) | Prerequisites, cloning, configuring `.env`, running the full stack with `make dev` (Docker) or the no-Docker local path, first login, and common first-run errors. |
| [Core Concepts](concepts.md) | The six-stage research pipeline, the Voyage long-running agent (Navigator / Helm / Sextant), the skill system, and the MCP read-only tool layer, explained in depth. |
| [Literature guide](literature.md) | The literature stage in practice: direction libraries and their inclusion config, ingest runs, the daily arXiv feed, wikis, and search. |
| [Ideas guide](ideas.md) | The idea and idea-review stages: Idea Forge gap analysis, scoring, the research proposal builder, and the Elo review tournament. |
| [Experiments guide](experiments.md) | The experiment stage: SSH credentials, intake, compute-budget gates, runs with streamed logs and metrics, and the iterate loop. |
| [Writing guide](writing.md) | The paper-writing stage: LaTeX projects and templates, collaborative editing, agent drafting bound to real metrics and citations, and compilation. |
| [Paper review guide](paper-review.md) | The paper-review stage: citation existence and support verification, number fact-checking, and the multi-perspective reviewer agents. |
| [PolarisBuddy](buddy.md) | The in-app assistant: chat, plan, and goal modes, the tool loop, page context, and per-user memory. |
| [Skills](skills.md) | Packaging agent behavior as data: skill types, injection points, the marketplace, and per-run snapshots. |
| [The Task System](task-system.md) | The long-running agent tasks (`VoyageRun`): the data model, the three run modes, library vs. topic tasks, who can see what, the action registry, acceptance checks, checkpoints, budgets, logs, failure handling, and the cron schedules. |
| [Literature Management](literature-management.md) | The single content pool and the four collections on top of it (direction library, topic shelf, personal library, daily feed), library ownership and management rights, tags, the trash, and the paper lifecycle: download, extract, chunk, embed, extract figures, compile, delete + orphan GC. |
| [Wikis & Concepts](wiki-and-concepts.md) | How a paper's wiki gets written (the three compile triggers, full text vs. abstract, figures and `![[fig:N]]`, why compiling carries no library context) and how concepts come out of it: names harvested from `[[wikilinks]]` in the prose, definitions batched to an LLM, placeholders and backfill, relink, orphan cleanup, plus the `paper_wikis` / `concepts` / `paper_concepts` model and concept scoping. |
| [Embedding & Retrieval](embedding-and-retrieval.md) | The two vector representations (paper-level vs full-text chunks), how and when each is built, the `chat_fulltext_index` opt-in, and how semantic search and literature chat retrieve (pgvector, graded fallback). |
| [MCP](mcp.md) | Connecting Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor to your research workspace: the two transports, topic scoping and permissions, the read-only tool catalog, recipes, limits, and how to check a connection. |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | The public-facing system design: layered backend, ARQ worker, LLM abstraction with DB model routing, the deterministic-vs-judgemental split, data stores, and real-time channels. |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | Reference table of every environment variable and setting from `.env.example` (database, cache, secrets, LLM providers, literature APIs, data directory, model routing). |
| [LLM usage and costs](llm-usage.md) | Token accounting by provider and model, cache hit semantics, per-call price snapshots, unknown values, and estimated usage. |
| [Development](development.md) | Local development workflow: repo layout, running the stack, migrations, tests, linting, the layering convention, and the branch-per-feature Git workflow. |
| [Deployment](deployment.md) | Production deployment with Docker Compose: the prod overlay, bind-mount data directories, restricted-network build args, migrations, ports, and backups. |
| [Desktop](desktop.md) | The Electron desktop client: process model, the `app://` protocol, the IPC contract, packaging, and unsigned-distribution notes. |

## Where things live

- Source code: `src/backend/` (FastAPI app package `app`, ARQ worker package `worker`),
  `src/frontend/` (React + Vite), and `src/desktop/` (the Electron shell).
- Docker configuration: `docker/` (base compose plus dev and prod overlays, per-service Dockerfiles,
  nginx config).
- These docs: `docs/`.
